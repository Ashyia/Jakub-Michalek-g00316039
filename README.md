*<p>4.Backstory</p>*

Kingdom got overrun by malicious bats, you as the *Drake Warrior* are the only one who can stop the and protect the Kingdom from collapsing!
Gather Your Strenght and slay foes who come with ever increasing numbers.

*<p>5.What I've learned</p>*

Other than the fact that this project has taught me how to use Markdown, how sprite maps work, animation frames. loading resources in javascript and plethora of other things I have also learned something greater.
I have learned to respect hard work and craftmanship in simple things, once you spend 10 hours fixing aimations and hitboxes for a flying bat object so it doesnt look like a complete ass you will change your outlook
on certain aspects of not only programming but everyday life also.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*<p>6.Things I would change</p>*

Everybody should be striving for perfection be it hobby or real life tasks, I do realise my game is basic, but its functional, if I had more skill and perhaps time I would like to find out how to introduce pick up's(Proably do an action if sprite animation of the drake touches an object that has random % chance to dorp, perhaps even change way the drake fires to include North-East and South-East.

*<p>8.Closing Thoughts</p>*

Working on this project has made me realise that I do enjoy working with graphics and breaking down problems to their basics then building them up
I will be trying to create a full fleshed-out game come the Honours Degree proably basing it on a similiar concept to what was done here(Ref.6)
